## Voice Output Notes
- pyttsx3 uses your system's TTS engine.

- On Windows, it uses SAPI5 (e.g., voices like David, Zira).

- On macOS, it uses NSSpeechSynthesizer (e.g., Samantha, Alex).

- On Linux, it typically uses eSpeak (can be customized).

## Privacy & Connectivity
- Your voice is processed locally, except for Googleâ€™s free speech recognition.

- For 100% offline, consider replacing Google API with vosk, whisper, or similar.
